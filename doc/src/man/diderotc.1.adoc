NAME
----
diderotc - compiler for the parallel domain-specific language Diderot


SYNOPSIS
--------
*diderotc* ['OPTIONS'] 'FILE'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The diderotc(1) command compiles Diderot source code into either a library
(the default) or a stand-alone executable.
The Diderot language is a parallel domain-specific language for image-analysis
algorithms that supports a high-level mathematical programming model based
on the differential tensor calculus.


OPTIONS
-------
*-h, --help*::
  Display a list of command-line options and then exit.
  This list includes additional options used to support development and debugging of
  the compiler.

*-H*::
  Display a list of *all* of the command-line options and then exit.  This list
  includes compiler controls that are meant for debugging the compiler.

*--version*::
  Show the compiler version and exit.

*--about*::
  Show information about the Diderot language and compiler and then exit.

*--exec*::
  Compile the Diderot program to run as a standalone executable.

*--json*::
  When compiling to a library, this option generates a JSON description of
  the library's API.  Note that this option is incompatible with the *--exec* flag.

*-o 'OUTFILE', --output*='OUTFILE'::
  Use the name 'OUTFILE' as the stem for the generated code files.
  When coupled with the *--exec* flag, 'OUTFILE' will be the name of
  the executable.

*--namespace*='PREFIX'::
  Specify a namespace prefix for generated interface to the Diderot program.
  The default namespace prefix is +Diderot+.

*--snapshot*::
  Generate code to get a snapshot of strand states (ignored if the *--exec* flag
  is given).

*-g*, *--debug*::
  Enable assertions and debugging information in the generated code and runtime system.

*--double*::
  Use double-precision floating-point for the Diderot +real+ type.

*--long-int*::
  Use 64-bit integers for the Diderot +int+ type.

*--scalar*::
  Do not generate vectorized code (*i.e.*, code that uses the **gcc* vector extensions).

*--log*::
  Emit a log file of the compiler's intermediate representations.
  This option is mainly used to debug the compiler.

*--stats*::
  Collect and report statistics about optimizations, etc.

*--verbose*::
  Print messages to stderr as each compiler stage starts and ends.

*--target*='TARGET'::
  Specify the target platform for the generated code.
  The 'TARGET' can be one of the following options:
+
--
  *sequential*;;
    single-threaded sequential implementation.
  *parallel*;;
    parallel implementation for shared-memory multiprocessors using pthreads.
ifdef::debugger_enabled[]
  *debugger*;;
    generate a version of the program that can be run under the Diderot debugger.
endif::debugger_enabled[]
ifdef::opencl_enabled[]
  *opencl*;;
    parallel implementation for GPUs using OpenCL (if supported).
endif::opencl_enabled[]
ifdef::cuda_enabled[]
  *cuda*;;
    parallel implementation for GPUs using CUDA (if supported).
endif::cuda_enabled[]
--
+
Note that not all targets are supported by all installations.  Use the *--help* command to
determine which targets are supported by a given instance of the compiler.

*--C*'VAR'='VALUE'::
  Specify (or override) the value of the constant variable 'VAR' when compiling
  the program.  Note that constant variables are not available in Version 1 of
  the Diderot language.


OUTPUT FILES
------------
The *diderotc* compiler produces one or more output files, depending on the command-line
options.
These files will have a common stem, which will either be the stem of the source file (i.e.,
'foo' for the source file 'foo.diderot') or the name specified by the *--output* option.


RUNTIME OPTIONS
---------------
The executables produced by the compiler when using the *--exec* option recognize
a number of standard options.

*-h*, *--help*::
  Print usage information and then exit.

*-o* 'STR', *--output* 'STR'::
  Specify the name of the output file (the default is the name of the output
  variable).  If the Diderot program in question has multiple outputs, then
  for each output named 'foo', there will be options *-o-foo* and *--output-foo*
  for overriding the filename of that particular output variable.

*-print* 'FILE'::
  Specify where to direct printed output.  The default is standard output.

*-l* 'NUM', *--limit* 'NUM'::
  Specify the limit on the number of super-steps taken by the program to 'NUM'
  (0 means unlimited). The default is unlimited.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
  Enable runtime-system messages to standard error.

*-t*, *--timing*::
  Report execution time to standard output.

*-s* 'NUM', *--snapshot* 'NUM'::
  Generate a snapshot of the strand state after every 'NUM' super-steps.  This option is
  only present if the *--snapshot* option was given to the compiler.

*-sp* 'STR', *--snapshot-prefix* 'STR'::
  Specify a prefix for the snapshot files.  The default is the name of the
  output variable being captured.  If the Diderot program in question has multiple
  outputs, then for each output named 'foo', there will be options *-sp-foo* and
  *--snapshot-prefix-foo* for overriding the snapshot prefix for that particular
  output variable.

*-n* 'NUM', *--nworkers* 'NUM'::
  Specify the number of worker threads for parallel execution.  The number of workers
  is limited to the number of available cores, which is also the default value.
  This option is only present for the *parallel* target.

In addition, there will be options corresponding to any +input+ globals that
are declared in the Diderot program.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

*DIDEROT_TEEM_DIR*::
  If this environment variable is present, it is used to specify the path
  to the Teem installation.
  The *diderotc* compiler uses this path to find teem executables, libraries, and include
  files that are used during the compilation process.
  The default is **{teem_dir}**.
