# The Diderot language compiler

This repository is the future home of the first official release of
the source code for the Diderot compiler and runtime system.

Diderot is a _Parallel Domain-specific Language_ for image
analysis and visualization.
It is designed to support a class of algorithms that are programmed
in terms of *continuous* scalar, vector, and tensor fields that
are reconstructed from the image data.
Diderot provides a high-level mathematical programming model for
these algorithms, while also providing high-performance implementations
on a variety of parallel hardware platforms.

**NOTE**: we are getting ready to upload the source soon
